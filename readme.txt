Save time when SEO editing and edit the SEO relevant areas in a tabular overview. This plugin avoids unnecessary loading time and eliminates the need to switch to another article or page. In the SaaS version, this plugin can also edit external content that is connected via an API

== Description ==
### SavTee SEO: save time and organize your content maintenance 

Our SaaS offer also allows maintenance for sites or shops with API - centrally in Savtee. NO more backend login for the most important TAGs of your site. With the SaaS Tool agencies can, once the connected system has been configured, log in to an external target system to be selected via the universal backend "per click" and make changes there very quickly. There is no need to worry about extensive training or loading times, which makes work faster and keeps costs down. In addition to the central editing option, the presentation is also within the central backend in tabular form, instead of per page in the respective backend, constructed so that no article changes as in the target systems are more necessary. This saves the user immense time and thus the cost to the customer again. Updating work, performed via the universal interface, will also result in e.g. "Only" shop operators can obtain a high saving potential.
